## 2025-05-02 - Fix XSS vulnerability via open redirect scheme validation
**Vulnerability:** The open redirect logic allowed absolute URLs without verifying their scheme, opening the door for XSS via `javascript:` or `data:` schemes (e.g., `javascript://example.com/%0Aalert(1)`).
**Learning:** Checking `IsAllowedHost` is insufficient if the scheme is not explicitly restricted to `http` or `https`, as browsers will execute code for other URI schemes while still matching the hostname.
**Prevention:** Always ensure that an absolute URL's scheme is strictly limited to `http` or `https` in combination with host whitelisting when processing redirects.
